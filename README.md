# Async Tessellation Unity Port

> **Unity Port of My Master’s Thesis Prototype**

This repository contains a *fast implementation* of the **Asynchronous Software Tessellation** prototype for **Unity**. It adapts the core algorithm and implements async compute features from the original DirectX 12 project:
